title: About Frank van Meeuwen
---

<p>I am an experienced freelance full stack developer and scrum master, living in Utrecht, the Netherlands. I have graduated in computer science, specializing in artificial intelligence. For the past 10 years, I have been working as full stack developer using various programming languages (such as .Net, Java/Scala), tools and techniques, building complex systems.</p>

<p>Having experienced programming using several languages made me discover the differences and the strengths of each of the programming languages. Through the time, I learned to appreciate functional programming and now become passionate about it. I have been using Scala (together with Akka) for the last two years, to build highly scalable concurrent systems. I am now a big fan of Scala. Programming more functional greatly increases my productivity and eases reasoning about complex pieces of code.</p>

<p>I am also passionate about working agile and lean, empowering teams to become self-organizing. I have experienced a boost in long-term productivity by this, as well as teams being more focused on delivering value.</p>

<p>Currently I am working as freelance full stack developer/scrum master and I am always open for a challenge: short-term projects, consultancy, giving advice as subject matter expert.<br/>
